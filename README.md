## Introduction

MOSTest is a tool for join genetical analysis of multiple traits, using multivariate analysis to boost the power of discovering associated loci. If you use MOSTest software for your research publication, please cite the following paper(s):

* Dennis van der Meer, Oleksandr Frei, et al. Understanding the genetic determinants of the brain with MOSTest. 
  Nat Commun 11, 3512 (2020). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-17368-1

## Prerequisites

MOSTest is implemented as a script in MATLAB and python. We tested MOSTest with the following software configuration:
* Ubuntu 18.04.
* MATLAB (tested with 2017a)
* Python (tested with 3.7); required libraries: ``pandas, numpy, h5py``

Other versions are likely to work well too. 
Since MATLAB and Python are cross-platform we expect MOSTest to run well on Windows and MacOS too.

## Install MOSTest

To install MOSTest you simply download or git fetch this repository (https://github.com/precimed/mostest) into an empty folder (which we refer to as `<MOST_ROOT>`),

## Data preparation

MOSTest require the following input files

1. plink bfile (.bim, .bed and .fam files) with genotypes to test for association
2. Phenotype file, stored as a tab-separated table. First line must be a header, and subsequent rows corresponding to individuals.
   All columns must indicate phenotype measures to be jointly analyzed by MOSTest.

NB (!) Rows in the phenotype file must correspond to the same set of individuals,
in exactly the same order, as the .fam file of you bfile argument.
NB2 Missing values should be coded as 'NaN' in order to be handled correctly

## Run MOSTest (demo)
Download ``mostest_demo.tar.gz`` file from [here](https://1drv.ms/u/s!Ai1YZmdFa9ati40Inztrv_4erqcdWw?e=ixWDUe)
and extract it into ``<MOST_ROOT>>``, i.e. to the folder that contains ``mostest.m``.
This package contains a small synthetic dataset for chromosome 21, N=10000 subjects, M=149454 SNPs, K=10 phenotypes.

To run MOSTest, set your current folder to ``<MOST_ROOT>``.
Then start matlab, define ``pheno``, ``out``, ``bfile``, ``snps`` and ``nsubj`` variables as shown below,
and execute ``mostest.m`` script:
```
pheno = 'pheno.txt';            % full or relative path to the phenotype file
bfile = 'chr21';                % full or relative path to plink bfile prefix
out = 'results';                % prefix for the output files
mostest                         % starts the analysis
```

Alternatively one may use ``zmat_name`` argument to re-use the original and permuted z-scores from previous MOSTest run:
```
zmat_name='results_zmat.mat'; out = 'results'; mostest
```

To convert MOSTest results from ``.mat`` format to text files, use the following script in python:
```
python process_results.py chr21.bim results
python process_results_ext.py chr21.bim results
```

[process_results.py](process_results.py) and [process_results_ext.py](process_results_ext.py) scripts accept the following arguments:
```
Usage: process_results.py <bim> <fname> [<out>], where
 bim   - path to bim file (reference set of SNPs
 fname - prefix of .mat files output by mostest.m, 
         i.e. fname should be the same as "out" argument of the mostest.m
 out   - optional suffix for output files, by defautl fname will be used
```
The ``process_results.py`` produces text files with MOSTest and MinP p-values, while
``process_results_ext.py`` produce all univariate GWAS results across all input phenotypes.

The demo takes few minutes to complete. Output of the demo is as follows, highlighting
14436 genome-wide significant SNPs discovered by minP, and 20986 by MOSTest.

```

Note that it is also possible to use ``mostest_light.m`` script, instead of ``mostest.m``.
``mostest_light.m`` uses much less memory by skip saving univariate results.
However it is not possible to run ``process_results_ext.py`` on the results from ``mostest_light.m``.

## MOSTest results

MOSTest results are saved in .mat files (MATLAB format), in files called
```
<out>.mat      - main results, i.e. -log10(pval)
<out>_zmat.mat - gwas Z scores (original and permuted)
```

Output of ``process_results.py``:
* ``<out>.most.sumstats`` - summary statistics file for MOSTest p-values (note that Z values has a fake direction)
* ``<out>.minp.sumstats`` - as above, but based on minP
* ``<out>_most.zmat.csv`` - GWAS z-scores across all measures for genome-wide significant SNPs according to MOSTest
* ``<out>_minp.zmat.csv`` - as above, but for SNPs passing 5e-8 according to minP
* ``<out>.plot.png``      - QQ-like plot highlighting distribution of minP and MOSTest p-values 
* ``<out>.plot.csv``      - data underlying the above plot

## Other considerations

* all phenotypes should be pre-residualized for covariates, for example in R as follows:
  ```
  TempModel <- summary(lm(get(f) ~ Age + Sex + Scanner + Euler + genBatch + C1 + C2 + C3 + C4 + C5 + C6 + C7 + C8 + C9 + C10, data=DM)) 
  DM[,which(colnames(DM)==f)] <- TempModel$coefficients[1,1] + TempModel$residuals
  ```

* by default all phenotypes are automatically inverse-rank transformed into a normal distribution, 
  in a way equivalent to the qnorm(ecdf(...)) function in R:
  ```
  DM[,f] <- qnorm(ecdf(DM[,f])(DM[,f]) - 0.5/dim(DM)[1])
  ```
  If you want to disable this step, specify ``apply_int=0; ``  in your matlab script before running ``mostest``.

* we recommend that bfile only include SNPs with MAF above 0.5%

* MOSTest spends most time in matrix operations, which by default in MATLAB utilize all available computation threads
  (unless MATLAB is started with ``-singleCompThread`` flag). Therefore, for large-scale analysis we recommend to run
  MOSTest on a large server with 16 or more CPUs available.
